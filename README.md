## What This Will Be

**DiveTank Pro** is a comprehensive web and mobile management system for scuba tank fill stations. It will streamline operations for tank fills, inspections, deliveries, equipment tracking, and customer management - eliminating paper tickets and manual processes.

**Business Problem We're Solving:**
Your shop currently manages 100-200 tanks using paper logs, WhatsApp messages, and phone calls. This leads to:
- Missed orders and lost revenue
- Inefficient customer communication
- Manual payment collection
- No visibility into daily operations
- Compliance tracking gaps

**Our Solution:**
A modern, mobile-first web application that replaces paper with digital workflows, automates notifications, tracks certifications, and provides real-time operational insights.

## Approval Process

### Step 1: Review All SPEC Documents
- Read through each document above
- Understand what IS included in each epoch
- Understand what is NOT included (future versions)
- Note any questions or concerns

### Step 2: Ask Questions
- Create comments in the SPEC documents
- Email questions to: [your-email]
- Schedule a review meeting if needed

### Step 3: Decide on Epoch Commitment
Choose one of the following:

**Option A: Conservative (EPOCH 1 Only)**
- Investment: ~$800
- Validates concept with MVP
- Decide on EPOCH 2 after testing

**Option B: Recommended (EPOCHS 1-3)**
- Investment: ~$2,700
- Complete operational system
- Customer portal + delivery + compliance

**Option C: Full System (EPOCHS 1-4)**
- Investment: ~$3,400
- Includes online payments and analytics

### Step 4: Formal Approval
Once you're ready to proceed:

1. I will create **GitHub Issue #1: SPEC Approval**
2. You review the approval checklist in that issue
3. You close Issue #1 to formally approve
4. Development begins immediately

## What Happens After Approval

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. Scope is **locked** for approved epoch(s)
   - Any changes require new approval process
   - Prevents scope creep and timeline delays

2. Development begins following **23-step TDD cycle**:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement features
   - Document continuously
   - Commit with validation gates

3. You receive **regular progress updates**:
   - GitHub commits (visible history)
   - Completed user stories marked
   - Blockers communicated immediately

4. **EPOCH 1 Timeline** (if approved):
   - Week 1-2: Foundation (Django, DB, Auth)
   - Week 3-4: Core features (Tanks, Orders)
   - Week 5-6: Polish, testing, deployment

5. **Two Approval Gates**:
   - Gate #1: SPEC approval (this step) ✅
   - Gate #2: Acceptance testing (before ship)

## Questions?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Can I add features later?**
A: Yes! That's why we have multiple epochs. Each epoch builds on the previous one. You can stop after any epoch if you're satisfied, or continue adding features.

**Q: What if requirements change during development?**
A: Minor clarifications are fine. Major changes require scope review and may impact timeline/budget. We follow a scope change management process (see SCOPE_BOUNDARIES.md).

**Q: How do I know it's working correctly?**
A: Every feature has >95% test coverage. Plus, you'll perform hands-on acceptance testing before we ship to production (see ACCEPTANCE_TEST_PLAN.md).

**Q: What if I only want to build EPOCH 1 first?**
A: Perfect! That's the recommended approach. Build EPOCH 1, test it in real operations, then decide if you want EPOCH 2. No commitment to all epochs upfront.

**Q: How long until I can use it?**
A: EPOCH 1 takes 4-6 weeks. After acceptance testing passes, you can use it immediately. We'll help with onboarding and training.

**Q: What about support after launch?**
A: Included for 60 days post-launch. After that, we can arrange ongoing support or you can maintain it yourself (open-source stack).
